# DiscordTS-Template
A very simple Discord bot made with **TypeScript** & **discord.js** version 14.

## Installation
Install all the required dependencies:

```sh
npm i discord.js@14 discord.js-v14-helper@latest dotenv mongoose ms
```

> **Note:** The `mongoose` and `ms` are not used in this project, but my library called `discord.js-v14-helper` requires both of them.

To compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript files, use the command below:

```sh
npm run build
```

or, start the old compiled JavaScript files:

```sh
npm run build-start
```
